# SGPP Beamer Template

A beamer template created for thesis defense presentations at the School of Government and Public Policy (SGPP) Indonesia. I initially developed this for my own thesis defense back in early 2021, but thought it may be useful for other SGPP students. Otherwise, non-SGPP students wishing to use this template are free to do so since you can customize the colors.

### Preview

The sections are still based on the ones I used so you may have to customize it to reflect the order of sections in your thesis (see preview below)
